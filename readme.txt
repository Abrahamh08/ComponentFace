Includes:
UIButton
UIToggleNotification

Instructions:

Add the GreenSock folder from greensock.com to this library in 'com.videogamecheatsultra.ComponentFace'.

UIButton:

Add the UIButton class to a movie clip that has a first frame of button up and a second of button being clicked.  In the MovieClip, make another layer and in the layer for both frames (one frame stretched), create a textField called 'butLabel'.  It must be dynamic, and the movie clip will stretch itself if the text is too big.  Feel free to make the button a rectangle primitive with a radial gradient.  Make sure the registration point is the top-left.

UIToggleNotification:

Add this class to a MovieClip that is a triangle or whatever shape that is facing right.
